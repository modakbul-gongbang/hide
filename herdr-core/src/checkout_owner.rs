//! Which Herdr workspace owns a checkout (PRD checkout-workspace-binding).
//!
//! A checkout has one owner Herdr workspace, read from Herdr rather than
//! inferred from where its tabs sit (D-06). For a Git checkout it is the
//! workspace Herdr binds to that checkout path (`worktree.checkout_path`,
//! set only by `worktree.open` and `worktree.create`); a plain folder cannot
//! be bound, so its owner is the live workspace carrying Hide's own mark, a
//! workspace token whose value is a digest of the device and the folder
//! (D-11). Every tab Hide creates in a checkout goes to its owner, and a
//! checkout without one gets one first (D-07); a tab in any other workspace
//! still shows under the checkout its cwd names and is never moved (D-08).
//!
//! The owner is decided from the session Hide already receives, so a
//! snapshot costs no Herdr call; only creating a tab in a checkout with no
//! owner opens one (B16).
