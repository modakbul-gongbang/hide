//! What the background AI providers can do right now, read for the Settings

//!
//! Answering costs child processes: `codex app-server` is started and asked
//! for the account and its model list, and `claude auth status` is run. So
//! this reader is shaped like the project panel's readers rather than like a
//! projection: the session-sync coordinator drives it, `read_if_due` decides
//! whether anything runs, the work itself happens on
//! [`BackgroundRead`](crate::reader::BackgroundRead)'s worker thread, and the
//! runtime mutex is never held across any of it.
//!
//! Every provider backend here is a [`NodeBackend`]: the router stays in
//! the core and each backend call is answered by the core's own node, which
//! runs the provider processes with its logins (`hide_host::ai`).
//!
//! It also reads nothing at all while nobody is looking. `observing` is false
//! unless the Background AI group is on screen, and an unobserved request
//! answers from no provider, so an idle Hide starts no provider process.
