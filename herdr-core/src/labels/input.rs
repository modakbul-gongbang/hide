//! When the operator submitted something to a pane through Hide (PRD
//! overview-request-view D-19).
//!
//! Herdr's input calls carry no sender, so who wrote a person's message in a
//! conversation is decided from what Hide itself saw: the desktop's and a
//! device pane's keyboard (the node's input report) and the phone's reply
//! (`pane_input_submitted`). Only the moment of a submit is kept, never what
//! was typed. The runtime records under its own lock; the label workers read
//! from their coordinator threads; this record has its own small lock, taken
//! after the runtime's and never around it.
//!
//! Memory only and bounded: a restart starts empty, and a message written
//! before this process saw the pane is judged by its envelope and lineage
//! alone (B51).
