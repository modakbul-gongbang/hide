//! Puts a pane's hook tokens back on a Herdr that lost them.
//!
//! The hook helper reports a pane's `hide_hooks`, `hide_sub_working` and
//! `hide_sub_done` tokens after each of its events and keeps what it
//! reported in the pane's file under `~/.hide/agent-hooks/panes/`
//! (`hide_agent_hooks::counters`). Herdr keeps a token only as long as the
//! server that took it: a live handoff or a restart starts the new server
//! with none, while the pane ids stay (measured on the pinned Herdr, and
//! the reason a file can be paired with a pane at all). Until the agent's
//! next event the pane then reads as a session that predates Hide's setup,
//! with a Reopen that restarts a healthy session (issue 799).
//!
//! The rule is the lineage writer's: the agent list the coordinator already
//! reads each second is the observation, and a pane that lacks its token
//! while its file has one is written, not a pane that changed. It differs in
//! what makes a pane worth asking about again. A lineage patch is a pure
//! function of the ledger, so it can be compared with the list on every
//! read. A file is read from disk, so each pane is asked once for each
//! connection to Herdr (every connect is a bootstrap, and a handoff or a
//! restart ends the connection); a pane with no file, or one an older helper
//! wrote, is not asked again, because the helper's own next event reports
//! the token and writes the file in the same step.
//!
//! A pane id alone does not say that the agent in the pane now is the one the
//! file describes, so the file also names the agent that reported and the
//! session it reported for, and Herdr names what it detects in the pane now.
//! The version token is put back when the agent is the same one: a hook is
//! installed in a runtime's configuration, not in a session. The counts are
//! put back only when the session is the same too, and are left out, not
//! written as zero, when Herdr names no session or another one, so the pane
//! reads as an instrumented agent whose children are not known until its
//! next event. Nothing here relies on `SessionStart` having reset the file:
//! a session that started after the file was written and before this
//! connection is exactly the case the session id tells apart.
//!
//! The file is read and the report is sent on a worker thread: the
//! coordinator never waits on either (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, the
//! session-sync thread never blocks). One batch is in flight and one waits,
//! at most [`BATCH_LIMIT`] panes each; panes beyond that stay unasked and are
//! taken by the next observation. A failure is retried at most [`ATTEMPTS`]
//! times for a connection and written to the diagnostic log with the pane.
