//! The Software Factory host: the core owns one engine thread that runs every
//! Factory on this machine (PRD software-factory, Technical structure). The
//! engine never runs under `Mutex<Runtime>`; it takes the lock only to read
//! owned values or to ask the runtime for a delivery, a sleep or a wake.
//!
//! The engine opens its store the first time it is asked, or at start when a
//! store already exists, so a machine without a Factory pays nothing.
