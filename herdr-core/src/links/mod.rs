//! The link record (PRD link-graph): which sessions worked on or made which
//! pull request, which issue a pull request closes or was linked to, and the
//! branches and worktrees between them, kept after a pane closes and after a
//! session file is gone.
//!
//! The record only says a link held, with its source and its first and last
//! time; what a pull request, CI, a worktree or a pane is now is read from
//! GitHub, Git and Herdr as before, and wins over the record (D-27).
//!
//! `store` owns the SQLite file (`links.sqlite3`), `worker` the one thread
//! that writes it, and `runtime/links.rs` what the runtime hands the worker
//! and publishes.
