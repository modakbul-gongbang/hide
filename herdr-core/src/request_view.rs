//! The request view's row (PRD overview-request-view): what the operator
//! asked each agent, what came of it, and what is theirs to do now.
//!
//! Everything here is derived from facts the core already holds, with no AI:
//! the session's own words the label worker read (`labels::facts`), Herdr's
//! state and Hide's read and demand axes on the row, the lineage, and the
//! pull requests GitHub reported. The verb is computed in `agent_state::turn`;
//! association and duty belong to `agent_state::work`. This module assembles the block.
//!
//! A row's pull requests are those of its checkout's branch and those its
//! session made (D-31, D-46). A pull request on several rows gives its duty
//! (fix, review) to one of them: the row on that branch's checkout, else the
//! row whose session printed it first.
