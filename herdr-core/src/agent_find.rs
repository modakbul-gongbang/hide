//! The agents that search their own conversation, and the keys that open it.
//!
//! A full-screen agent (Claude Code with `tui: fullscreen`, Codex on its
//! default alternate screen) keeps its conversation inside itself: Herdr holds
//! no history for the pane, so a search of what Herdr holds finds only the
//! rows on screen. The agent's own find covers the whole conversation and
//! scrolls to each match, so ⌘F hands such a pane to it and the agent's own
//! prompt, keys and count take over. An agent that draws inline leaves its
//! conversation in Herdr's history, and Hide's find bar searches that, so the
//! decision also asks Herdr whether it holds any (`live::spawn_agent_find`).
//!
//! Adding an agent is one row in [`agent_find`]; an agent without one keeps
//! Hide's find bar.

/// How one agent's own search is opened, in Herdr's key names for
/// `pane.send_keys`. Every key is a mode switch in the agent: none of them
/// submits, interrupts or edits what the operator typed.
