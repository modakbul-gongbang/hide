//! The tab moves Hide has sent Herdr and not yet seen answered.
//!
//! Hide owns the visible tab and tells Herdr afterwards. Herdr's session
//! stream has no cursor naming the request an event answers, so whether a
//! Herdr move is Hide's own answer or somebody focusing a tab outside Hide is
//! read from one list: the tab moves that have left the control lane and not
//! been answered, in the order they left. Two facts give that order meaning.
//! The lane sends one control at a time and the next only after Herdr has
//! answered, so Herdr applies the requests in the order they were sent; and
//! Herdr delivers its events in order within a subscription (Socket API,
//! Event subscriptions), so the moves they make arrive in that order too.
//! The replica keeps those moves, one per `tab_focused`, and each session
//! carries the ones it has not been read with (`SessionTabMoves`): a session
//! ending on t2 cannot say whether Herdr went t2 or t2, t3, t2.
//!
//! The rest is derived from the list:
//!
//! - Each Herdr move answers the earliest request on its tab, and every
//!   request sent before that one has been applied already, so they leave
//!   with it. A session alone never answers anything: until the moves of
//!   earlier requests have arrived it shows Herdr from before them.
//! - A request for the tab Herdr shows moves nothing, and the pinned Herdr
//!   publishes no event for it, so its answer is the whole answer. Herdr
//!   does publish one for any other tab, another workspace's active tab
//!   included, so which tab Herdr shows is one value, not one per workspace;
//!   each request records it as it leaves (the tab of the request before it,
//!   or with none outstanding, the tab the last session showed).
//! - A refused request leaves at once and moved nothing, so the request
//!   after it takes over where Herdr was; a lost or silent one waits out the
//!   deadline, since Herdr may still apply it.
//! - Herdr moving on its own is followed only when nothing Hide asked for in
//!   that checkout is outstanding, sent or still waiting on the lane.
//! - When moves were dropped between two sessions (more than
//!   `TAB_FOCUS_LIMIT`, or a new replica after a reconnect), the tabs newly
//!   active since the last session stand in for them.
//!
//! A request still waiting on the lane is not in the list. The lane holds it
//! (and the pane focus intent its turn will send), and nothing of it can
//! reach Herdr until it leaves.
