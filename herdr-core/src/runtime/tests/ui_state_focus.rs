//! A whole-state save cannot move what the core owns about focus.
//!
//! The shell's `ui_state_update` carries its last copy of the UI state, and a
//! choice made since (a click on another pane, another checkout, another
//! device) can already have overtaken that copy. The keyboard's pane, the
//! checkout and the device move on their own events, which tell Herdr; a save
//! moves none of them. Issue 672: a save built before a pane click put the
//! core back on the pane the operator had left, and following Herdr back to
//! the clicked pane later took the keyboard from the tab-name field the
//! operator was typing in.
