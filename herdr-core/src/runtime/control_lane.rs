//! The one ordered lane for the Herdr controls Hide sends on its own socket.
//!
//! A control passes through four states, and this module owns the first
//! three for the controls that share the lane:
//!
//! - **Queued**: accepted, not sent. Nothing about it can reach Herdr, so a
//!   newer request that replaces it leaves no late answer behind.
//! - **In flight**: sent, unanswered. Herdr applies it whatever Hide has
//!   decided since, so a request replaced now is *superseded*: its answer is
//!   still coming and must not be read as someone else moving the focus.
//! - **Settled**: answered, refused, or lost. The runtime records the result
//!   where it always did.
//!
//! One socket operation runs at a time and the rest wait in arrival order.
//! Before the lane, each control ran on a thread of its own, so a tab focus,
//! a tab creation and a pane focus sent a moment apart could reach Herdr in
//! either order, and the screen then followed the wrong one.
//!
//! Only this machine's Herdr is on the lane. A device's controls keep their
//! own connection and generation (`live::spawn_remote_control`), which no
//! other request of this process shares.
