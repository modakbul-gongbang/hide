# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Report it privately through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting for this repository: open the **Security** tab and choose **Report a vulnerability**.
Do not open a public issue.

You will get an acknowledgement within a week.
Fixes ship as a normal release; the advisory is published once the release is out.

## What is in scope

- The hide app: the Electron desktop host under `desktop/`, the web shell under `web/`, the daemon under `hided/`, and the Rust core under `herdr-core/`.
- The build and release scripts under `scripts/` and the workflows under `.github/workflows/`.
- The bundled Herdr runtime pin. hide ships a specific Herdr binary and verifies its digest at build time; a problem in Herdr itself belongs to [Herdr](https://herdr.dev), but a problem in how hide pins, verifies, or launches it belongs here.

## What hide does not do

Hide delegates provider sign-in to the installed agent CLIs and remote authentication to the operator's existing SSH configuration.
It does not ask the operator to paste a provider API key or an SSH password into the app.
Hide does generate and store its own authentication material, including the daemon's local client token, phone pairing credentials and Project Memory receipt keys.
Treat local state, app databases, pairing information and run artifacts as private; do not attach them unredacted to a public issue or pull request.
A report that exposes credentials, bypasses an authentication boundary, or discloses private local content is in scope.

Project Memory and background labels can send bounded session content through the user's authenticated provider CLI.
The current disclosure, local redaction and provider boundary are documented in [AI providers](docs/AI_PROVIDERS.md); do not assume that local storage makes all analysis offline.

## Supported versions

Only the latest release receives fixes.
