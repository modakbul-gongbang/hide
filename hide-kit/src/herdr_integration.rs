//! Herdr's own integration for an agent, installed and removed through the
//! machine's Herdr CLI (PRD settings-cleanup D-13).
//!
//! Herdr learns an agent's session id, and for some agents its lifecycle,
//! from a hook script or plugin that `herdr integration install <agent>`
//! puts in the agent's configuration. Lineage, the mailbox identity, labels
//! and sleep all need that session id, so the kit installs it when the
//! operator switches the agent on, on this Mac with the bundled Herdr and on a
//! device with its own.
//!
//! Hide only ever takes out what it put there: the kit's record names the
//! integrations it installed (`herdr:<agent>`), and an integration that was
//! already in place when Hide first looked is the operator's and stays, on and
//! off. Every call is one owned child with a deadline and a cleared
//! environment but `HOME` and `PATH` (`crate::process::run`), so a daemon
//! started from a Herdr pane never aims it at that pane's server. Only the
//! kit pass calls it, never anything holding the runtime lock.
//!
//! The CLI reports every target in one `status` listing, one
//! `<target>: <state> ... (<path>)` line each, with the state `not installed`,
//! `current (vN)` or `outdated (vA < vB)`.
