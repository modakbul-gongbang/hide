//! The kit's step that has Codex trust Hide's own hooks (PRD codex-hook-trust).
//!
//! `hide_agent_hooks::codex_trust` does the work; this decides when. A pass
//! that finds the Codex hook part in place asks Codex to record trust for it,
//! so Codex starts without its "Hooks need review" screen for Hide's entries.
//!
//! A failure is the part's one-line reason and its detail goes to the log.
//! `status` runs every few seconds while Settings is open and starts no
//! process, so it cannot ask Codex again; it repeats what the last pass found
//! instead. That is a memory of this process, not a record: a connection or
//! a launch is a new process and starts with a pass (`apply`), and a pass
//! replaces it, so a failure the operator then fixed in Codex stays on the row
//! until the next pass or Reinstall.
