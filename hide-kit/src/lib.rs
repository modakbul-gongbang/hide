//! Hide's install kit: the one list of what Hide puts on a machine, and how
//! each part is installed, judged and removed.
//!
//! The same code runs for this machine, inside `hided`, and for a device, inside
//! `hide-host-helper`; only the [`KitTarget`] differs, so a device gets
//! exactly what this Mac gets (PRD device-parity D-09, D-10). Adding a part is
//! adding a [`ComponentId`] and its three answers here; nothing else in the
//! product learns how to install it.
//!
//! Three rules hold for every part:
//!
//! - what another tool wrote is never touched: a hook entry without Hide's
//!   marker, a `hide` that is not Hide's link, a plugin config folder (D-15);
//! - a part that failed does not stop the others, and says why (D-18);
//! - a part the kit installed and the operator then took away stays away
//!   until the operator asks for it again with Reinstall (D-20, D-26). The
//!   kit's own record of what it installed is what tells "taken away" from
//!   "never installed"; `~/.hide/agent-hooks/installed-once` from before the
//!   kit is not such a record (B20).
