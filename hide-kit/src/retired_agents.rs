//! The thirteen agents Hide stopped supporting (PRD settings-cleanup D-06):
//! the one-time pass that takes out what an earlier build put on a machine
//! for them.
//!
//! An earlier kit wrote a skill stub and, for six of them, a SessionStart
//! guidance hook, and recorded each in `~/.hide/kit/installed.json`. This pass
//! reads that record for ownership: only a piece the record names is looked
//! at, and then only what carries Hide's own marker is taken (the stub's
//! marker line, the hook entry's `hide-guidance` source), so a file the
//! operator wrote or edited stays. Each piece leaves the record once it is out,
//! and an agent with nothing left in the record is not looked at again, so a
//! later pass asks nothing and rescans nothing; a piece that could not be
//! taken out stays in the record and the next pass tries again.
//!
//! A transition path: it goes with the release after the one that ships it,
//! together with the layouts of the six hooks in `hide_agent_hooks::guidance`.
