//! What the kit does for each agent the operator switched on: the skill stub
//! and, for an agent with a guidance hook, that hook (issue #517), and for
//! OpenCode, Hide's plugin.
//!
//! It follows the rules every other part follows (`crate` docs): what
//! another tool wrote is never touched, a piece that failed does not stop
//! the others and says why, and a piece the kit installed and the operator
//! then took away stays away until Reinstall. The record's `agents` map is
//! the operator's choice; its `installed` set holds `hook:<agent>`,
//! `skill:<folder>` and `herdr:<agent>` (Herdr's own integration, installed
//! through the machine's Herdr CLI) for what the kit has put down.
//!
//! Claude Code and Codex keep their hook as a kit part ([`HookSupport::Part`])
//! because Memory, pane diagnosis and the device rows read it there. Their
//! switch gates that part here ([`part_gate`]); everything else about the
//! part is the code that already ran.
