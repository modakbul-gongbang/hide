//! The agent adapters: which coding agents Hide knows how to reach, and what
//! it puts where each one reads it (issue #517).
//!
//! The leaf `hide-agent-adapter` crate declares each agent's programs, skill
//! location, hook dialect and documentation. This module projects those
//! declarations into kit pieces and owns their installation policy. The content an
//! agent reads is the same for all of them and is read from the `hide` binary
//! at run time (`hide browser help`), so a new agent needs a shared declaration
//! and a fixture, never another copy of this content (engineering rule 2, 7).
//!
//! Three things a row can turn on for an agent the operator switched on:
//!
//! - the `hide-browser` skill stub, in the folder the agent reads
//!   ([`SkillDir`]); the folder is shared by every agent that reads it, so
//!   the stub stays while any of them is on;
//! - a hook: Claude Code and Codex keep their kit parts
//!   ([`HookSupport::Part`]); Cursor and Grok, whose documented command hooks
//!   can refuse a shell call and report subagents, get Hide's hook file of
//!   the basic tier ([`HookSupport::Guidance`]);
//! - nothing else. What Hide never writes is listed in `docs/agent-hooks.md`.
