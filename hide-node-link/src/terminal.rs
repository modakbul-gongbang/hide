//!
//! A node owns its panes' terminal attaches and their bytes: keys from the
//! screen reach the node's writer and a frame from Herdr reaches the screen
//! without passing the core. The core decides which panes attach and keeps
//! the facts it projects; it says so with [`TerminalControl`] and hears what
//! happened as [`TerminalReport`]. Neither carries a key or a frame's bytes,
//! except the few writes the core itself makes (a click's mouse report, a
//! pasted attachment's paths).
//!
//! Pane ids here are the node's own: a device's node knows its panes by its
//! Herdr's ids, and the screen side scopes them to the device.
