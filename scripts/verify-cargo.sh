# The PRD harness runs each verify command with execvp and no shell, so an
# `ENV=value cargo ...` binding fails with ENOENT at verify time rather than at
# configuration time, and a sealed run cannot be amended to fix it. A script is
# the only place an environment decision can live, which is why this file exists
# rather than a longer command string in `agents/config.json`:
#
#     "test": "bash scripts/verify-cargo.sh test"
#     "lint": "bash scripts/verify-cargo.sh lint"
#
# Every build lands in the worktree's own `target/`, whatever CARGO_TARGET_DIR
# the caller carries: the desktop packager reads the release binaries from
# `target/release/` at that fixed path, and a build directory shared between
# worktrees reads the other checkout's artifacts as fresh. `git worktree
# remove` takes the cache with the work. See docs/BUILD.md.
