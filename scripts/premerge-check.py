"""Answer whether a pull request may merge into main as main is now.

CONTRIBUTING.md, "Merging into main", owns the policy; this is its check.

A pull request's `verify` ran on its merge with main as main was when the run
started, and main moves on after that. Updating a green branch only so that
`verify` runs again is what slowed busy days: every merge sent every other
green pull request back through a full run and the runner queue. What two
changes that each passed break together without a conflict is mostly a
compile, type or baseline failure (on 2026-10-05 one pull request removed an
export another one imported, and both had passed), and those checks finish in
about two minutes on the merge result itself. A behavior only the two changes
together break is left to main's push run, which plans every lane.

Usage: python3 scripts/premerge-check.py <pull request number>

Exit status: 0 the pull request may merge now, and the merge command is
printed; 1 it may not, and the output says what to do instead; 2 the check
could not decide, and the output says why.
