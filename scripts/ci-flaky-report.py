"""Turn one CI run's test outcomes into GitHub issues.

Playwright and cargo-nextest retry a failed test once in CI. Each lane's report
step reads its tool's own report (Playwright's JSON, nextest's JUnit):

- a test that passes the retry is flaky, and the run passes. The step files it
  as an issue labelled `quarantine` with a seven-day deadline, or adds the run
  to the open issue that already tracks it;
- a test that fails the retry too failed the lane. The step writes it on the
  job as an error annotation titled `Failed test`, with the test's file and
  line and its name on the first line of the message, and files nothing: the
  annotations are the record the nightly report reads, and the run's summary
  page shows the names.

    ci-flaky-report.py --suite web --playwright web/e2e-report.json
    ci-flaky-report.py --suite rust --junit target/nextest/ci/junit.xml

A run with a flaky test also sets the step output `flaky=true`, so the lane
keeps the same logs it keeps for a failure: the first attempt's daemon, Herdr
and input logs are the evidence its issue needs, and a passing job uploads
nothing otherwise.

The nightly's report job (`--nightly`) is the one writer of `nightly-failure`
issues, so the run's cap, the recurrence comments and the closing never race:
one issue per test a lane annotated, or, for a failed job with no such
annotation, per lane and failed step; a comment per run attempt on the issue
already open for the same failure; and a lane that passes a scheduled run on
main closes its issues. docs/TESTING.md, "Flaky tests" and "Nightly failures",
owns the policy.

    ci-flaky-report.py --nightly --lane-input all
    ci-flaky-report.py --nightly --repo OWNER/REPO --run RUN_ID --dry-run

It talks to GitHub through `gh` (GH_TOKEN, GITHUB_REPOSITORY and the run's
GITHUB_* variables come from Actions). A lane's step needs `issues: write` and
must not fail the lane: the flaky run already passed, and the report is a
notice, so a GitHub error costs one missed issue the next flaky run files. The
report job needs `actions: read`, `checks: read`, `pull-requests: read` and
`issues: write`, and fails when GitHub does, so a failure it could not file is
a red job rather than a silence.
