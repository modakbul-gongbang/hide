"""A script that runs cargo must reuse the machine's toolchain, not install one.

rustup resolves its toolchain from RUSTUP_HOME, which defaults to
`$HOME/.rustup`. A verification runner gets its own HOME, and rustup answers
that empty directory by downloading and installing the whole toolchain into it
while still exiting 0:

    $ env HOME="$(mktemp -d)" cargo --version
    warn: the missing active toolchain `stable-aarch64-apple-darwin` has been
          auto-installed
    $ echo $?
    0

Because the exit code is 0, nothing downstream notices. Every run directory
under `agents/runs/` had grown its own copy: 1.3 GB of `.rustup` plus 128 MB of
`.cargo` per run, 9.1 GB across eleven runs.

`rust-test.sh` and `swift-test.sh` had both already diagnosed this, and both
workarounds were unreachable for the same reason: they were guarded by a cargo
invocation failing, which the auto-install prevents. Resolution now lives once,
in `toolchain-env.sh`. This test is what keeps the next cargo-running script
from rediscovering the problem rather than sourcing it.
