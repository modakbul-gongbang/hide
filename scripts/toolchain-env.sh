#
# rustup resolves its toolchain from RUSTUP_HOME, which defaults to
# `$HOME/.rustup`. A verification runner gets its own HOME, so that default
# names an empty directory, and rustup does not fail there: it downloads and
# installs the whole toolchain into it, saying so only in a warning.
#
#     $ env HOME="$(mktemp -d)" cargo --version

#     info: downloading 6 components
#     warn: the missing active toolchain `stable-aarch64-apple-darwin` has been
#           auto-installed
#     $ echo $?
#     0
#
# That exit 0 is what made the earlier workaround in `rust-test.sh` dead code.
# It recovered RUSTUP_HOME only inside `if ! cargo --version`, and the shim
# never takes that branch; it pays for a download instead. `swift-test.sh` read
# the same success and took its cargo-is-available branch after the same
# download. Neither script was wrong about the cause, and neither one ran.
#
# The cost was measured rather than guessed. Every run directory under
# `agents/runs/` had grown its own private copy: 1.3 GB of `.rustup` plus
# 128 MB of `.cargo` per run, 9.1 GB across eleven of them, duplicating a
# `~/.rustup` that was already installed on the machine.
#
# The real toolchain is found from the shim rather than from a literal path,
# because `cargo` on PATH is that shim and rustup installs its home beside the
# shim's own. An explicit RUSTUP_HOME or CARGO_HOME still wins, so a caller
# that means to use a different toolchain says so.
#
# See AGENTS.md, "Build Output Belongs To Its Worktree".
