"""Deal the web end-to-end tests out to CI shards by how long each one takes.

Playwright's own `--shard` cuts the tests in file order into runs of equal
count, and the suite's tests range from 1 second to a minute, so one shard held
11 minutes of work while another held 6. `split` reads the tests Playwright
lists (`playwright test --list`) and `web/e2e/shard-durations.json`, gives each
test its recorded seconds (a test the table does not know gets the table's
median), and fills the shards longest test first, each into the shard with the
least work so far. The same list and table always give the same shards, and
every listed test lands in exactly one shard. The output is a file for
`playwright test --test-list`.

`check` compares what Playwright lists for that file with what `split` planned,
because Playwright treats a `--test-list` that matches nothing as a pass.
`durations` writes the table from the job logs of earlier runs: the median
seconds of each test's passing line in the list reporter's output, for the tests
a `--list` output names. docs/TESTING.md, "Balancing the web e2e shards", says
when and how to refresh it.

Everything is read and written as UTF-8 (a title holds `›` and other characters
the locale encoding of a Windows runner cannot write), and a problem with the
list, the table or a shard is one line on stderr and exit status 1, never a
traceback.
