# reader, the project panel's worktree, GitHub, and disk readers, the
# Background AI provider probe, and the Weekly Usage reader's `claude -p
# /usage` child - never run under the runtime mutex or on a per-event path.
# All but one are driven by the session-sync coordinator thread. The changes
# reader is driven by its own pump (`ChangesPump` in `changes.rs`), which the
# core starts once: History reads each checkout through that checkout's host,
# so a device's History must not wait on this machine's Herdr session.
#
# Both properties are structural, so they are asserted structurally: the
# runtime module holds the mutex, so it must fork nothing; and the readers'
# entry points must be reachable only from their one driver.
