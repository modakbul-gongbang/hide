"""One-second CPU deltas and RSS samples for owned process trees.

usage: resources.py <hided-pid> <herdr-pid> <chrome-pid> [--memory-series]
MEASURE_RESOURCE_SECONDS sets how many one-second samples (20 by default).
A chrome pid of 0 samples no browser (a windowless window).
CPU is one-core percent from process CPU-time deltas, not ps's lifetime average.
Each one-second sample also keeps the root's own RSS and each child's, named
by its accounting name (ps ucomm), so a short child is told apart from the
root growing. No command line, environment, or operator socket is read.
