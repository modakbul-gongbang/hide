// Lost and reordered keys (PRD core-host-node-terminal D-08): types
// MEASURE_KEY_COUNT keys (10,000 by default) into the web shell's terminal
// through the shell's own key path, one CDP `Input.dispatchKeyEvent` per
// key as key-echo.mjs does, then reads the pane's content back from its
// isolated Herdr and counts the keys that never arrived and the ones that
// arrived out of order. It does not stop at the first loss: every count is
// reported.
//
// The keys spell distinct markers (`mNNNNN` and a space, Enter after every
// 100th), so a lost or moved key also breaks a marker. The pane runs
// `stty -echo -icanon; cat`, so what Herdr holds is what the pane received.
// MEASURE_PANE_READ is the shell command that prints the pane's logical
// lines (default: `$HERDR_BIN_PATH pane read $MEASURE_PANE_ID --source
// recent-unwrapped --lines 4000` on the private socket); for a device pane
// it reads the device's isolated Herdr over SSH.
