# hided installs its node with folders it spells `~/` from the SFTP home,
# which is the account's own home even where a private sshd gives its
# commands another HOME: on 2026-10-09 a probe with the `~/` defaults
# uploaded its node into a real account's ~/.hide/host-helper. So the private
# sshd's port (MEASURE_DEVICE_PORT) is never 22; the private HOME
# (MEASURE_DEVICE_HOME) lives under /tmp, where no account's own home does;
# the consent folders are absolute and inside it; and the device's Herdr
# socket is named under /tmp, so nothing asks for the account's default
# Herdr.
#
# The SSH alias is never read from a caller's configuration: hided's parser
# and OpenSSH read some spellings (`Port=22841`, a tab, `Include`, `Match`)
# differently, so a file this guard accepted could send hided to port 22.
# The guard takes the alias's parts (MEASURE_DEVICE_ALIAS, _HOST, _PORT,
# _USER, _IDENTITY) and writes the one configuration hided reads
# (device_guard_config); this harness's own ssh calls pass the same parts
# with no configuration file. The recorded host key (MEASURE_DEVICE_KNOWN_HOSTS)
# names that host and port only and is the only key file read (no global
# one), so no other sshd's key is trusted.
