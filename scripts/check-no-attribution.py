"""Reject AI tooling attribution in the branch name, commits and PR body.

CONTRIBUTING.md states the policy; this is its check. It was written against
one run's prepared body and only ever ran for that run, so the PR body is now
an argument and the commit range has a default any branch can use.

The policy is about crediting a tool, not about naming one. This repository
integrates two AI CLIs on purpose, so a change whose whole subject is one of
them has to be able to say so. Two rules keep those apart:

- An attribution phrase always fails, wherever it appears. Quoting it does not
  make it a citation.
- A tool name fails unless it is a reference: inside a code span or fence, part
  of a path or identifier, or one of the product names spelled in full.

Say `claude -p` and `codex app-server` in backticks, or write Claude Code and
Codex CLI in full. A bare "Claude" or "Codex" in prose reads as a byline, which
is the thing the policy forbids.
