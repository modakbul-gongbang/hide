"""The core decides and keeps state; it never touches a machine (PRD
core-host-node D-21). Files, processes, the Herdr socket and session files
are a node's, reached through `NodeLink`; this check fails when production
code under `herdr-core/src` reaches one directly.

Test code is exempt: test-only files, a module file its parent declares
behind `#[cfg(test)]`, and every item behind `#[cfg(test)]`. The core's own
stores are excused by name below, each with the reason it is the core's and
not a machine fact, and so is what a later layer of the PRD moves out, named
with that layer; nothing else may join either list without a reason. Each
excused file carries the number of machine touches it has, so a new one in
an excused file fails like one anywhere else.
