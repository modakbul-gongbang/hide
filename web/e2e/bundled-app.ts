// The debug build laid out as an installed app's resources, the one place a
// daemon runs the install kit (`hide_kit::bundled_kit_dir` reads the layout by
// name on every system), so a fixture daemon meets what a packaged one does,

// compares builds by content, so the bundle is the build it was linked from,
// and nothing is copied. A link cannot cross volumes, and a Windows runner's
// temporary folder is on another drive, so the bundle sits beside the build
// in `target/debug`, one per worker, and is removed when the worker exits.
