// The debug build laid out as an installed app's resources, the one place a
// daemon runs the install kit (`hide_kit::bundled_kit_dir` reads the layout by
// name on every system), so a fixture daemon meets what a packaged one does,
// the first-run choice included. The binaries are hard links: `hide connect`
// compares builds by content, so the bundle is the build it was linked from,
// and nothing is copied. A link cannot cross volumes, and a Windows runner's
// temporary folder is on another drive, so the bundle sits beside the build
// in `target/debug`, one per worker, and is removed when the worker exits.
//
// A packaged app also carries the pinned Herdr in its resources, which the kit
// installs agents' Herdr integrations with. The plain bundle leaves it out, so
// a daemon's kit sees no Herdr CLI and touches no agent's Herdr integration; a
// spec about those integrations asks for the `herdr` bundle, a second one per
// worker, so whether a daemon has Herdr never depends on which spec ran first.
