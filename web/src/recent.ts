// One recent-use order over every surface the shell holds, across every
// device, project and checkout: this machine's Herdr tabs and the View-area
// displays (file, diff and browser) of each checkout's Workspace, each
// connected device's Herdr tabs (PRD home-device-rail D-16), and the page's
// shared Overview page and its scope, once the
// operator has been on them.
// Recent Panels walks it; Recent Projects walks the projects in the order
// they were used and restores each one's last Workspace surface, which is
// this same order narrowed to the project. Beside it, one recent-use order
// of the terminal panes the keyboard has been in, on every device, project
// and checkout, whose agent panes the Agent area's cycle walks (issue 301). The core reports what is in
// front, not what was before, and the screens are the page's own navigation,
// so these orders are the shell's convenience: nothing here is authority, and a
// reload rebuilds them from use. The pane order is the exception: the page
// still decides what a visit is, since only it knows where the keyboard is,
// but the core keeps the order (`ui_state.recent_pane_ids`) and saves it, so
// the Agent cycle survives a reload and a restart.
