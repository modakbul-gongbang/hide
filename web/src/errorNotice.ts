 * only read it would vanish before it could be read; a notice is the shell's own and stays.
 * Only a failure the operator can act on is one (design principle 13):
 * - a command a remote host refused (a lost connection, a close that needs confirming);
 * - a View action or open the core refused (S7 B19);
 * - a Reopen that ended the agent and could not start it again, which the operator answers by Reopening
 *   again: nothing is left on the pane to carry it, since the Not connected chip is read from the agent's row.
