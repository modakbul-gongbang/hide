//! This daemon in the node role (PRD core-host-node-remote-core D-02, D-04,
//! D-08, D-09): the core runs on another machine, which the placement record
//! names, and this daemon keeps one link to it. It dials the core's machine
//! over SSH, runs the attach role there, trades the handshake, and answers
//! the core's calls on that channel exactly as a device the core dialed
//! answers them, with its own Herdr reached through the link.
//!
//! While the core cannot be reached the node waits and tries again, two
//! seconds after the first failure and doubling to a minute; a link that
//! lived a while starts the wait over. A watch thread looks every two
//! seconds for what makes the wait wrong (D-09): when the machine slept or
//! its network addresses changed, a node waiting on what a move may change
//! (the core's machine unreachable, a connection that failed on the way, a
//! link that was lost) tries at once, a node the core refused or that has
//! something to fix keeps its wait, and a live link must answer an SSH ping
//! within three seconds or is dropped and dialed again; while the core's
//! machine is unreachable, its SSH port is probed and the node tries at once
//! when the port answers again. Dropping the role ends the link, the SSH
//! connection and both threads.
