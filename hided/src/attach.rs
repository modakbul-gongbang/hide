//! How a node on another machine reaches this core (PRD
//! core-host-node-remote-core D-04, D-07, D-10).
//!
//! The node dials this machine over SSH and runs `hided attach` here. That
//! attach role starts no core: it finds the core already running on this
//! machine through the attach socket the core records in its state folder,
//! and pipes the node's SSH channel to it byte for byte. With no core to
//! find it answers `no_core` and exits.
//!
//! The attach socket sits in a fresh owner-only folder, so only processes
//! of this account reach it; they are inside the core's trust boundary
//! already (they can read its screen token). On it, the core and the node
//! first trade one line each: the core names its node and build, the node
//! names its own and its Herdr socket. A different build, this machine's own
//! node id, a device this core dials, or a node whose earlier link stands is
//! refused with a reason line. Otherwise the core answers with the relay
//! grant for the node's screens and the stream becomes the node's link.
//!
//! The attach role ends when its node's channel ends, when the core's socket
//! closes, or when its node has sent nothing for
//! [`hide_node_link::panes::HEARTBEAT_LIMIT`], so neither a half-open SSH
//! connection nor a stopped core leaves it running (B20).
