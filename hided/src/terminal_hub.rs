//! The screen side of the terminal path (PRD core-host-node-terminal D-11,
//! D-16, D-22): every pane's output, from this machine's node or a
//! device's, reaches the `/ws` clients from here without passing the core.
//!
//! Each chunk is rendered once, as the JSON object a `terminal` frame
//! carries, and shared: a pane's recent chunks (at most
//! [`RETAINED_CHUNKS`] and [`RETAINED_BYTES`]) and every client's unsent
//! queue hold the same allocation, so a pane's retention stays under
//! `RETAINED_BYTES + MAX_UNSENT_OUTPUT_BYTES` and its latest full frame
//! however many clients are connected. One sequence numbers every chunk of every pane; a client's
//! cursor is the last one it was sent, so one number resumes every pane.
//! The cursor is good only with the hub that gave it: each hub has its own
//! epoch, a frame carries it beside the cursor, and a client resuming with
//! another epoch (a page that outlived its daemon) has every pane drawn
//! again.
//!
//! A client that leaves a pane's output unsent past
//! [`MAX_UNSENT_OUTPUT_BYTES`] loses that pane's backlog and gets nothing
//! more of it until a full frame, which it asks the pane's node for, and
//! asks again each [`REDRAW_RETRY`] none answers, quiet pane or not, for at
//! most [`REDRAW_PENDING_LIMIT`]. A full
//! frame replaces whatever of its pane waits for a client, since it draws
//! over it, and is never counted against the cap, so a pane whose full
//! frame alone passes the cap still draws. A
//! client that resumes from a cursor the retained chunks no longer reach,
//! for a pane, is treated the same way for that pane. Either way the pane is
//! drawn whole, never left blank or drawn from a broken stream, and the
//! redraw is counted in the diagnostic log.
//!
//! A client's unsent chunks wait pane by pane, taken in the order the hub
//! numbered them, so a full frame, an overflow or a forget touches only its
//! own pane's chunks, and frees them after the lock is released.
//!
//! A chunk past [`MAX_CHUNK_BYTES`] is not drawn at all: its pane waits for
//! a full frame that fits, asked for when the long chunk was not full
//! itself, so a pane whose every frame is that long cannot loop.
