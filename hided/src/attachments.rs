//! Staging for terminal attachments (PRD B14, B15, D-02, D-08).
//!
//! The browser can read a dropped file's bytes but cannot name its path, so
//! hided is the one that stages them: the client uploads one file per stage in
//! binary frames, and a commit turns the staged files into the one
//! `terminal_attachment` event the Swift shell sends for a batch of paths. The
//! staged file's path is what the core pastes, so it lands in the app state
//! dir, where it outlives the paste; only the newest `STAGED_KEEP` files are
//! kept, so the directory cannot grow with use (engineering 15). The caps are
//! the core's own numbers (20 MiB per file, 40 MiB and 8 files per batch);
//! hided refuses past them here rather than making the core read a file it will
//! reject. A clipboard image stages at the exact path the core reads it from.
