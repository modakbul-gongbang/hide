//! This daemon on a screen machine whose core runs elsewhere (PRD
//! core-host-node-remote-core D-02, D-05, D-06, D-08): it starts no core.
//! It keeps its node's link to the core ([`NodeRole`]) and serves its own
//! screens on loopback exactly as a core's daemon does, `/ws` included, so
//! the screen and the desktop host cannot tell the difference.
//!
//! Each screen's core traffic (events, snapshots and deltas, answers) goes
//! to the core through one relay per screen on the link's SSH connection.
//! Terminals are drawn from this daemon's own hub: this machine's panes
//! from its own terminals without the link, every other pane from the one
//! terminals relay the node keeps to the core. So a key into one of this
//! machine's panes and its output never leave the machine.
//!
//! Each screen's relay is read as fast as its core sends, whatever the
//! screen takes: a screen that stalls holds at most 4 MiB of core frames,
//! and past that it is closed as fallen behind and reattaches (D-20, B17),
//! so it never stops the SSH connection every other screen, pane and the
//! link share.
//!
//! Keys and redraws for the core's panes wait, in order, while the
//! terminals relay is not there to take them (it opens after the link, and
//! again after it fails): at most 64 KiB, each at most 3 s, as the core
//! holds keys typed before a pane exists. A key past the bound is refused
//! to the screen that typed it; one that waited too long, was held for a
//! link that ended, or whose write was cut off is dropped and that screen
//! told, once per burst with the count and the cause; none is lost unsaid.
//!
//! While the link is down a screen is held: its socket stays open, every
//! frame it sends is dropped and counted, and nothing reaches it until the
//! link is back; a screen that was attached when the link ended is closed
//! once, so its next attempt is the held one (amendment 4 of the plan's
//! review). Keys typed meanwhile are never delivered later (B8).
