//! Which of two builds of hided is newer (PRD core-host-node-move D-10, Q3).
//!
//! A build is named by its hash (`build_id`), which says whether two builds
//! are the same and nothing about their order. A package also carries the
//! version it ships and its place in main's history, the first-parent
//! commit count `desktop/scripts/package.mjs` passes as `HIDE_BUILD_ORDER`.
//! Two builds are ordered by their release (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, whatever
//! follows it ignored) and then by that count. Builds that differ while
//! neither key orders them, or whose version names no release, are
//! unordered, as layer 4 refused every other build.
