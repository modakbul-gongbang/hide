# hide browser

Read and drive a browser display in hide, the one the operator is looking at.
Every command works on one display of your own checkout, by its View id from `hide view list` (for example `browser-3`).
Open a page with `hide browser open <url>`; the display stays when a command ends.

## Commands

    hide browser snapshot <display> [--interactive] [--diff | --grep <pattern>]
    hide browser click <display> (@ref | --text <label> | --xy <x> <y> [--space css|image])
    hide browser fill <display> @ref <text>
    hide browser type <display> <text>
    hide browser press <display> <key>
    hide browser hover <display> (@ref | --xy <x> <y> [--space css|image])
    hide browser drag <display> (@ref | <x>,<y>) (@ref | <x>,<y>) [--mode auto|pointer|html5] [--space css|image]
    hide browser scroll <display> (up | down | @ref)
    hide browser wait <display> (--text <text> | --selector <selector|@ref> [--gone]) [--timeout <ms>]
    hide browser screenshot <display> <path> [--ref @ref]
    hide browser eval <display> <expression>
    hide browser console <display>
    hide browser network <display>

click, fill, type, press, hover, drag and scroll also take `--verify <ms>` (how long to wait before checking what changed, default 300, at most 10000) or `--no-verify`.
`wait --timeout` defaults to 5000 and is at most 60000.
`press` knows Enter, Tab, Escape, Backspace, Delete, ArrowUp, ArrowDown, ArrowLeft, ArrowRight, Home, End, PageUp and PageDown.
Put `--` before a value that starts with `--`.

## Reading a page

`snapshot` prints the title, the address, a blank line, and one indented line per element:

    # Sign in
    # http://127.0.0.1:3000/login

    @1 textbox "Email" [email]
    @2 textbox "Password" [password]
    @3 textbox "Remember me" [checkbox checked]
    @4 combobox "Plan" = "Monthly"
    @5 button "Sign in" (disabled)
    @6 link "Forgot?" -> /reset

Each line carries the element's current state: checked, disabled, a select's chosen value, a link's target.
A field with no label of its own shows its value, or its placeholder while empty.
Password, card number, CVC, one-time code and similar values are never shown; you see the placeholder or label instead.
`overlay (covers page; interact or dismiss first)` means a modal or cookie wall covers the page: act on it before anything under it.
`(clickable)` marks a control with no role that still takes clicks.
`--interactive` keeps only the lines you can act on.
`--grep <pattern>` keeps the matching lines and the lines above them; a pattern that is not a valid regular expression is matched literally.

## Refs

`@N` names an element of the top document, including open shadow roots and same-origin frames.
A ref stays the same across snapshots of the same document, new elements get the next numbers, and a navigation starts again at `@1`.
A cross-origin frame shows as its own section, `# OOPIF <tag> origin=<origin>`, and its elements are `@<tag>:N`; its values and links show only their origin.
A ref from an older document, or from a frame that navigated, fails `ref_stale` instead of touching another element: take a fresh snapshot.

## Acting and checking

An action answers with one line of JSON: what it did, `changed`, and `next`, the command to look again.
`changed` lists the snapshot lines the action added (`+`) or removed (`-`), checked again for about two seconds on a slow page.
"no visible change within ~2s" means the action was sent but nothing showed yet: confirm with `wait` or `snapshot --diff` before you repeat it, or you may submit twice.
After three actions in a row that changed nothing, the answer says you are likely stuck: try another element, dismiss what covers the page, or hand off to the operator.
`snapshot --diff` shows only the lines added and removed since your last snapshot of the same kind, says when there is no earlier snapshot or the address changed, and says so in one line when nothing changed.

The usual loop:

    hide browser snapshot browser-3 --interactive
    hide browser fill browser-3 @1 "a@b.c"
    hide browser click browser-3 @5
    hide browser wait browser-3 --text "Welcome"
    hide browser snapshot browser-3 --diff

`click --xy` and `hover --xy` take CSS pixels of the viewport; with `--space image` they take pixels of a screenshot taken now (`screenshot` reports the mapping as `css_to_image`).
`drag --mode auto` uses a native HTML5 drag when the source is draggable and pointer events otherwise; both ends must be in the same frame.

## What the operator sees

The display stays on the operator's screen while you work, and an arrow cursor in hide's accent color shows each action: it glides to the target, a click ripples, a drag leaves a line, filled fields flash, pressed keys are named, scrolls show an arrow.
It fades two seconds after the last action, lets clicks through, and never appears in a snapshot.
No command moves the operator's mouse, changes which View is in front, or takes keyboard focus.
Input and screenshots need the display in front: a hidden display fails `display_hidden`.

## When something fails

A failure prints one line of JSON, `{"ok":false,"reason":...,"display":...,"next_action":...}`, and exits non-zero.
Follow `next_action`; the reasons you will meet:

| reason | what to do |
| --- | --- |
| `ref_stale` | Take a fresh snapshot and use its refs. |
| `target_hidden` | The element is not visible; find a visible one in a snapshot. |
| `target_covered` | Another element (named in `detail`) covers it; act on that first. |
| `target_outside_viewport`, `outside_viewport` | Scroll the element into view, or use a point inside the viewport. |
| `text_not_found`, `text_ambiguous` | Use `snapshot --grep`, then click by `@ref`. |
| `target_not_fillable`, `option_missing`, `fill_rejected` | Fill a field that takes a value, with a listed option, or type the text instead. |
| `key_unsupported` | Press one of the listed keys. |
| `timeout` | The condition did not hold in time; look at a snapshot. |
| `eval_error` | Fix the expression. |
| `dialog_open` | A JavaScript dialog holds the page; the operator must answer it in hide. Dialogs are never accepted for you. |
| `display_hidden` | Ask the operator to show the display, or run `hide view select <display> --reveal`. |
| `display_busy` | Another debugger (agent-browser, Playwright) or another `hide browser` command holds the display; let it finish. |
| `display_unsupported` | Only http(s) and blank displays can be driven; open the page with `hide browser open <url>`. |
| `display_missing`, `display_closed` | Run `hide view list` and choose a current browser display. |
| `page_unresponsive` | The page did not answer in time; retry or ask the operator. |

Network rows come from the page's resource timing: no request or response headers or bodies.
`console` shows the messages the current document logged, newest first.
