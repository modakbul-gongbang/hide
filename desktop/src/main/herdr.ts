// HERDR_BIN_PATH is honored only as an explicit override: Herdr exports its
// own server's path into every pane together with HERDR_PANE_ID, and that
// path dies when the bundle that started the server is replaced, so a
// packaged app opened from a pane would hand `hide connect` a value it
// refuses on every attempt (issue 214). A value that arrives with
// HERDR_PANE_ID is therefore Herdr's, not the operator's, and the bundled
// binary replaces it. An unpackaged host has no bundled binary and adds
// nothing.
