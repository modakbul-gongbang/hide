//! What a core reaches on the machine of a node that dialed it, through the
//! node's link (PRD core-host-node-remote-core D-18, D-19, B15): each stream
//! the core opens with `link_open` is one local connection to the end it
//! names, its bytes carried by the link both ways. The node's own Herdr
//! socket is one end; the browser relay of the node's daemon, which carries
//! a caller's CDP to this machine's desktop window, is the other. Nothing
//! on the core's machine listens for either; the link is the only way in,
//! and it ends every stream when it ends.
//!
//! A stream is a byte pipe and nothing here reads what it carries. Each end
//! has its own cap ([`LinkEnd::cap`]); the next open is refused, and the
//! refusal goes to the core, which logs it with the node.
