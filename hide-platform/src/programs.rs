//! Where the programs an agent runs are looked for, and the one lookup every
//! crate uses to say whether an agent's CLI is installed.
//!
//! The search is the folders the account's login shell puts on its `PATH`,
//! then this process's own `PATH`, then the folders installers put a CLI in
//! that a daemon's `PATH` may not reach. The install kit's "is this agent
//! installed" and Hide AI's "can this agent be asked" both read it, so the two
//! cannot disagree about a program that only the shell's `PATH`, or only an
//! install folder, reaches.
//!
//! Asking the shell is a subprocess with a deadline, so the answer is kept
//! until a startup file changes (below). A caller on a hot path asks only
//! after a first read has warmed it.
//!
//! This is the one place the crate keeps anything between calls: the login
//! shell's answer is a fact about the account, not about a caller, so every
//! caller in the process reads the one cache (a kit worker, Hide AI's
//! backends and a device helper must not each start the operator's shell for
//! the same question), and it is keyed by the inputs it was read for, so no
//! caller's answer stands in for another's.
