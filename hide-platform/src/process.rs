//! Processes the app starts, and processes it only looks at.
//!
//! The one way a child is started is [`OwnedChild::spawn`]: the child leads
//! its own process group on Unix and lives in its own job object on Windows,
//! so ending it ends everything it started, and dropping the owner ends it
//! too (engineering rule 14; practice `process.md`). On Windows the job also
//! ends the child when the owner dies without running a destructor
//! (`KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`). [`OwnedChild::spawn_guarded`] adds an acknowledged
//! independent Unix owner channel for cooperative children that retain an
//! [`OwnerWatch`], without using or replacing stdin.
//!
//! What a caller can rely on, on all three systems (`tests/process.rs` checks
//! each line):
//!
//! - [`OwnedChild::kill_tree`] and dropping the owner end the child and every
//!   process it started, including ones that already left its direct line
//!   (while the child has not been waited for; a finished child's leftovers
//!   are ended by `kill_tree` at the moment it exits).
//! - [`kill_tree`] ends a process and its descendants by pid.
//! - [`is_alive`], [`parent_of`], [`descends_from`] and [`start_time`] describe a pid; a pid that
//!   does not exist is `false` or `NotFound`, never a default. A start time is
//!   an opaque number whose only use is to compare with itself, to tell a pid
//!   from a later process that reused it.
//! - [`measure_tree`] counts a process's descendants and sums their resident
//!   memory, reading the kernel's tables and forking nothing.
//! - [`run_to_end`] answers a child's exit code and capped output, or ends the
//!   child's whole tree when its deadline passes or the caller stops waiting.
//! - A pid that names no process a caller may signal (0 and 1) is refused with
//!   `InvalidInput` by every function that ends a process, so a damaged pid
//!   file cannot reach the caller's own group or the init process.
//!
//! Where the system cannot answer, the call says `ErrorKind::Unsupported`:
//! a Windows process has no working directory a caller can read, no process
//! group to signal, and no polite termination.
