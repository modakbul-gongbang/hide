//! Codex's trust review for the hooks Hide installed (PRD codex-hook-trust).
//!
//! Codex keeps a content hash for each entry of `~/.codex/hooks.json` in
//! `~/.codex/config.toml` (`hooks.state`) and starts no entry whose hash it
//! does not hold; any new or changed entry opens a "Hooks need review" screen
//! at the next start. Installing Hide is the operator's consent to Hide's own
//! hooks, so after the kit writes or re-checks them this module records that
//! trust, through Codex's own app-server (`hooks/list` to read each entry's
//! key, hash and status, `config/batchWrite` to store `trusted_hash`).
//! Hide never computes a hash and never writes `config.toml`.
//!
//! Which entries are trusted is the one decision here and it is narrow
//! ([`select_targets`]): an entry is a target only when Codex lists it from
//! this account's `~/.codex/hooks.json` and its command is, byte for byte, the
//! command [`crate::install`] writes for that event with this kit's helper.
//! Another tool's hook, a project's, a plugin's, and an entry that merely
//! carries Hide's marker over a different command are never read for trust and
//! never changed. `enabled` is never written: a hook the operator switched
//! off in Codex stays off.
//!
//! One other tool's entries join that list, and only through the kit's record
//! (PRD codex-herdr-hook-trust): the entries Herdr's own `herdr integration
//! install codex` added when the kit ran it ([`HookEntry`], learned by
//! [`learn_herdr_entries`] from what Herdr wrote, never typed here). They are
//! matched the same way, byte for byte, by the same [`select_targets`].
//!
//! The app-server is one short child per check, owned by [`Session`]: it is
//! started through the one spawn helper, bounded by one deadline and by the
//! caller's stop flag, and ended on every exit path, success, failure and
//! timeout alike. The caller runs it on the kit worker, never under the
//! runtime lock.
