//! Hide's extension for Pi and omp: one source (`pi_extension/extension.js`),
//! written as `~/.pi/agent/extensions/hide.ts` and
//! `~/.omp/agent/extensions/hide.ts`, the two differing only in the agent's
//! name (PRD pi-omp-extension D-01). omp is a fork of Pi with the same
//! extension shape; what only one host has (omp's subagents and `ask`) is
//! used where the host reports it.
//!
//! The file is plain JavaScript that is also valid TypeScript, in a `.ts`
//! file as Herdr's own extension for these agents is, so both hosts load it
//! from their user extension folder without a build step. Each prompt and
//! shell call asks the helper (`hide-agent-hooks pi|omp <operation>`,
//! `src/plugin/helper.rs`), and it tells the helper its version, so a file
//! another build wrote does nothing (B13).
//!
//! It goes only into the default agent folders, the ones Herdr's integration
//! uses; an omp profile or a `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` folder gets none (PRD
//! non-goal).
