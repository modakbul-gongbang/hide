//! A node's terminal service (PRD core-host-node-terminal): its panes'
//! attaches, the bytes that flow through them and the rules they keep.
//!
//! The core decides which panes attach and says so with
//! [`TerminalControl`]; this service attaches, holds, writes and reads, and
//! tells the core what changed with [`TerminalReport`]. A key from the screen
//! reaches a pane's writer through [`TerminalNode::key`] and a frame reaches
//! the screen through the [`OutputSink`], neither passing the core.
//!
//! The rules are the ones the core ran before this layer (D-12): an attach
//! waits for a size, a pane another client controls is observed once, a
//! frame at a grid the view is not drawn at is held until a full frame at
//! the view's grid, an observer whose view changed size attaches again, a
//! failed control attach is retried four times, and keys typed before a pane
//! can take them are held within their caps.
//!
//! One lock guards the service. A key, a frame and a control each take it
//! for a few map lookups; nothing under it waits on a process, a socket or
//! the core. Reports are handed to their sink under it, so a pane's states
//! keep their order. Output is decided under it and handed to its sink
//! after it, in the order it was decided ([`Deliveries`]), so encoding a
//! large frame for the screens holds up no key or control. Each sink must
//! return at once and never call back.
