//! A device's terminals inside its one node link (PRD core-host-node-terminal
//! D-10, D-18, D-19, D-20).
//!
//! On the device, [`NodeTerminals`] runs the node's [`Service`] for the
//! device's Herdr and sends what it says up the link: reports first, then
//! one line of output per pane in turn, so a pane that floods its output
//! cannot hold another pane's frames or the core's answers back. A pane
//! whose unsent output passes [`MAX_UNSENT_OUTPUT_BYTES`] loses it and is
//! drawn again from a full frame once the link has caught up. A full frame
//! replaces what of its pane waits and is never counted against the cap,
//! and a frame is always taken when nothing counted waits, so a pane whose
//! every full frame passes the cap still draws.
//!
//! On the core's side, [`DeviceTerminals`] is the device's [`TerminalNode`]:
//! it writes controls and keys down the link in the order they were given
//! and keeps at most [`MAX_UNSENT_KEY_BYTES`] of one pane's keys unsent,
//! counted as the keys' own bytes. Plain keys (no carriage return and no
//! escape) for one pane that wait behind each other go down as one line
//! carrying the last key's time, so a link that falls behind costs one frame
//! per run of keys, not one per key; an Enter or an escape always goes as
//! its own line, so the node's submit rule reads the same chunks it would
//! have, and a control or another pane's key ends a run. A pane
//! past the cap reads ended and refuses keys until it is attached again;
//! the keys it already took are written in order, or, when the link fails,
//! named in the log as unwritten. A link busy with another call writes the
//! line again once it is free; a link that ends takes every flow with it
//! and refuses later keys rather than keep them for another link.
//!
//! Keys are bounded per pane, so a pane's keys never end another pane's
//! flow (B18): besides its unsent key bytes, a pane may have at most
//! [`MAX_PANE_KEY_LINES`] runs waiting (an Enter or an escape is a run of
//! its own), and at most [`MAX_KEY_PANES`] panes may have keys waiting;
//! past either, that pane reads ended as above. The controls, views and
//! redraws waiting for the link are capped on their own at
//! [`MAX_WAITING_LINES`] lines and [`MAX_WAITING_BYTES`] bytes. A link that
//! falls that far behind is treated as stalled: what waited is dropped (its
//! keys named in the log as unwritten), later keys are refused, and the
//! writer ends the link, so the device's panes read unavailable and attach
//! again when 2b's reconnect brings a new link (D-19).
