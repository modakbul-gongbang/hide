//! The one SSH connection a node opens to its core on another machine (PRD
//! core-host-node-remote-core D-04, D-07): an exec channel that runs the
//! core machine's attach role carries the node's link, and the screen relay
//! reaches the core's loopback port through forwards on the same connection.
//!
//! The screen machine needs no SSH server of its own, only the alias. The
//! connection checks the core machine's key against `known_hosts` exactly as
//! a device the core dials is checked, and ends when its owner drops it.
