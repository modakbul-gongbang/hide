//! A node that dialed this core (PRD core-host-node-remote-core D-04, D-10):
//! its link arrives on the local stream the core machine's attach role hands
//! over, and from there it is a device link like any other. The same
//! [`RemoteHost`] carries its calls, its pane proofs and streams, its
//! terminals and its Herdr, so the credentials it vouches for are bound to
//! this link's identity exactly as a dialed device's are, and end with it.
//!
//! The core never dials such a node: [`establish`] hands it the link that is
//! already up as an [`Arrived`]; a link that ended is replaced only by the
//! node dialing again. Its Herdr is reached through the link
//! (`link_streams`), never through a socket on this machine.
